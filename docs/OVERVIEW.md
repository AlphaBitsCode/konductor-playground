# Konductor.AI - AI-First ERP Platform

## Project Vision

Konductor.AI is a revolutionary SaaS platform that transforms business management through AI-powered teams. Users (Human Konductors) create and interact with specialized AI Minions organized into different teams, all within an immersive pixelart environment inspired by GatherTown and WorkAdventure.

## Core Concept

Unlike traditional text-based SaaS interfaces, Konductor.AI provides a 2D pixelart playground where users navigate through different rooms/departments to interact with AI Minions. Each minion has unique personas, training documents, and tool access (skills/integrations). We will attempt to use CSS and Javascript technique for character movements instead of relying on complex rendering or game engines that might not run well on mobile browsers.
